        <h1>To My Best Friend 💙</h1>

        <div class="message">
            <p>
                Hi bro, when you asked for a paragraph about you, I had lots of things to say in my mind. But while
                typing, my mind seems to be blank and I don't know why. I am typing this in my laptop so I couldn't use
                emojis, I used 'haaaaa' for laughing instead! <span class="highlight">haaaaa</span> 😂
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                From the first day we started to talk until now, I felt like <span class="highlight">there is a person
                    always with me</span>. Whenever I want, I can talk and share everything that happens in my life.
                Sometimes I zone out, but I always come back, don't worry.
                This is my first paragraph I am writing in English, so definitely there will be grammatical and spelling
                mistakes—adjust it bro!
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Bro, it's really true, <span class="highlight">you are the only friend who spends so much money on
                    me</span>. No one before has spent money on me like you do—from the start involving the first
                biryani, remote control car, Muthu Kavitha cafe, ice cream, and again biryani.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I was so happy after I saw the <span class="highlight">remote control car</span> 🏎️. I didn't express
                it in front of you, but after I reached home, I didn't even wait for a second to play with it. Even my
                father hesitates to buy a remote control car for me, but you did it for me. <span
                    class="highlight">Thanks a lot, bro.</span>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I am a person who thinks once or three times before spending amount on everything, even for my AirPods,
                laptop, and mobile. But you are spending lots of your money on me. Sometimes I think, "Why is she doing
                this? Amount is very important." But for you, it's ulta—if you like a person in your inner circle, you
                don't even hesitate to spend money on them.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Because of that, lots of times I lied to you. If I said the truth, definitely you would spend amount on
                me. But in some scenarios, without my self-control, the words came out of my mouth, you caught those
                words and spent amount on me <span class="highlight">haaaaa!</span>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2rem;">
                Ok bro, there is a surprise for you. I have attached some audio below, go and enjoy it bro! 👇
